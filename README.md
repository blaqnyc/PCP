Converts Text File of Doctors From Insurance Provider into individual JSON Entries and Easily Searchable Hyperlinks to Quickly Find A Good Doctor.

This was created because I didn't want to search for doctors individually by copy and pasting their names into Google.
Instead it creates a JSON File as a Database of Doctors, and an HTML File that be used to easily search the Doctor's Rating.
